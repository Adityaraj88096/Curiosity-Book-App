# Curiosity-Book-App
> This was a personal project, made out of the curiosity to read books and the unavailability of good book readers with the functionality that I wanted.<br/>

The app has the following features:<br/>

1. Download any book you like.
2. Save the books in the app itself.
3. Read with a built-in pdf Reader.
4. Create Notes, with features like Adding Tags to track important Highlights/Notes.

## Steps to Start
Feel free to pull and use the app. Use the following steps:

```javascript
npm install 
```
```javascript
react-native run-android 
```
```javascript
react-native start
```
